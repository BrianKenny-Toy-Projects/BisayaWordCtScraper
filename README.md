This is a script for scraping Bisaya language news articles and sorting the words by freqency of use.  It's the first remotely usefull thing I've written in Haskell so expect some fugly. That said, it got the job done.

Usage:
./dist/build/scrape/scrape scrape  /Users/briankenny/tmp/  0 50
./dist/build/scrape/scrape count  /Users/briankenny/tmp/0to50.txt /Users/briankenny/tmp/counts.txt
